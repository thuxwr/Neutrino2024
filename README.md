# Introduction
This repository provides additional documents for Poster 569, "Analysis methods and the Bayesian approach for the KATRIN experiment".

The preprint of the KATRIN data release can be found [here](https://www.katrin.kit.edu/publikationen/PREPRINT_Direct_neutrino_mass_measurement_based_on_259_days_of_KATRIN_data.pdf).

# Files
## [The KATRIN spectrum](The%20KATRIN%20spectrum.pdf)
The beta decay spectrum for the KATRIN experiment, and the measured integrated spectrum. A neutrino mass dependency can be found in this file.

## [Detector response](Detector%20response.pdf)
The response function for the KATRIN spectrometer.

## [The shifted analyzing plane](The%20shifted%20analyzing%20plane.pdf)
Starting from KATRIN's third measurement campaign, a shifted analyzing plane was adopted as the default field configuration to suppress background. Details can be found in this file.

## [Main systematic sources](Main%20systematic%20sources.pdf)
KATRIN uncertainty is dominated by statistics; the main systematic uncertainties are listed and explained in this file.

## [KATRIN likelihood](KATRIN%20likelihood.pdf)
The formula of how KATRIN defines its likelihood function.

## [Belt](Belt.pdf)
The belt construction method to derive the upper limit for neutrino mass.

## [Bayesian data combination](Bayesian%20data%20combination.pdf)
The combination of all KATRIN measurement campaigns in the Bayesian framework.
